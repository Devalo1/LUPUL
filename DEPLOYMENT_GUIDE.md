### Step 6: Deploy!
1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Your site will be available at `https://random-name.netlify.app`

## üîß Build Configuration Files

The following files are already configured for optimal Netlify deployment:

- **`netlify.toml`**: Build and redirect settings
- **`package.json`**: Build scripts and dependencies
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Optimized for production builds
- **`.gitignore`**: Excludes sensitive files

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**: Check environment variables are set correctly
2. **OpenAI API not working**: Ensure `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Netlify env vars
3. **Firebase connection issues**: Verify all Firebase env vars are correct
4. **Routing issues**: SPA redirects are configured in `netlify.toml`

### Build Logs
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard if deployment fails
- Look for missing environment variables or build errors

## üìä Performance Features

The build includes:
- ‚úÖ Bundle splitting and tree shaking
- ‚úÖ Gzip and Brotli compression
- ‚úÖ CSS and JS minification
- ‚úÖ Static asset optimization
