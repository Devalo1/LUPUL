# NETOPIA Logo Implementation Guide

## Overview

The NETOPIA official logo has been successfully integrated across all payment-related components and pages on the website, as required by NETOPIA's visual identity guidelines.

## Logo Files Location

- **Primary Logo**: `/public/images/netopia-official-logo.svg`
- **Fallback Logo**: `/public/images/NP.svg`

Both logos are located in the public images directory and are accessible via the `/images/` path.

## Logo Implementation Pattern

All implementations follow this consistent pattern:

```tsx
<img
  src="/images/netopia-official-logo.svg"
  alt="NETOPIA"
  className="h-6 w-auto object-contain" // Adjust height as needed
  onError={(e) => {
    const target = e.target as HTMLImageElement;
    target.src = "/images/NP.svg";
  }}
/>
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Fallback Mechanism

If the primary logo fails to load, it automatically falls back to the NP.svg file.

### ✅ Responsive Design

Logo sizing is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### ✅ Accessibility

Proper alt text is provided for screen readers.

### ✅ Performance

SVG format ensures fast loading and crisp display at all sizes.

### ✅ Error Handling

Graceful fallback prevents broken images.

## Compliance Notes

This implementation complies with NETOPIA's visual identity requirements:

- Official logo files are used (downloaded from NETOPIA merchant dashboard)
- Logo is displayed prominently on all payment-related pages
- Proper attribution and links to NETOPIA are maintained
- Logo quality and proportions are preserved

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/PaymentPage.tsx`
2. `src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
3. `src/pages/CheckoutSuccess.tsx`
4. `src/components/payment/NetopiaPaymentInfo.tsx`
5. `src/components/payment/NetopiaSecurityInfo.tsx`
6. `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`

## Dependencies Removed

The following dependency was replaced with direct SVG usage:

- `ntp-logo-react` - No longer needed as we use the official downloaded SVG files

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing**: Verify logo appears correctly on all payment pages
2. **Responsive Testing**: Check logo scaling on different screen sizes
3. **Error Testing**: Test fallback mechanism by temporarily renaming the primary logo file
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify screen readers can access the alt text
5. **Performance Testing**: Confirm fast loading times for logo assets

## Maintenance

- Keep logo files updated if NETOPIA releases new versions
- Monitor fallback mechanism functionality
- Ensure logo links remain valid
- Update any hardcoded references if logo files are moved
